# DS_Portfolio
Hi, this is currently unfinished and if you are looking at this now, I'm sorry! I plan on adding my deep learning projects which you can find [here](https://www.github.com/Toastisgreat/deep_learning_projects). This is a portfolio of projects I have completed mainly outside of my academics and work, as my work is private due to the nature of the research. I don't think any of these are super common projects, these are mainly interests of mine that I coded things around. Let me know if you have issues by  [emailing me with my email](robertmg@ad.unc.edu). Thanks!
