Hi, this is currently unfinished and if you are looking at this now, I'm sorry! I plan on adding my deep learning projects which you can find [here](https://www.github.com/Toastisgreat/deep_learning_projects). This is a portfolio of projects I have completed mainly outside of my academics and work, as my work is private due to the nature of the research. I don't think any of these are super common projects, these are mainly interests of mine that I coded things around. Let me know if you have issues by  [emailing me with my email](robertmg@ad.unc.edu). Thanks!
## Table of Contents
- Math Visualization Projects
  - Visualization of general mathematical concepts, mostly just pretty graphs.
- Deep Learning Projects

Hi, this is currently unfinished and if you are looking at this now, I'm sorry! Certain parts of the Deep learning projects are depracated, and my windows machine instantly ran them and so some of the notebooks are broken :( I will try and fix this as soon as I can though! <br><br> This is a portfolio of projects I have completed mainly outside of my academics and work, as my work is private due to the nature of the research.
