# DS_Portfolio
Hi, this is currently unfinished and if you are looking at this now, I'm sorry! I plan on adding my deep learning projects which you can find [here](https://www.github.com/Toastisgreat/deep_learning_projects). This is a portfolio of projects I have completed mainly outside of my academics and work, as my work is private due to the nature of the research. 
## Table of Contents
- Math Visualization Projects
  - Visualization of general mathematical concepts, mostly just pretty graphs.
- Deep Learning Projects (Currently in different respository)
  - Collection of deep learning projects I did outside of school.
- Data Visualization
  - Visualization of data from actual data sets.
