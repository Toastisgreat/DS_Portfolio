# Deep Learning Projects
Hi!!! These are my Deep Learning Projects, 2 of them are complete as of this moment, and two have small deprecations that I need to update. The general idea for
each of them is:
 - BrainTumorDetection
   - Uses a VIT Classifier to determine whether or not a brain has a tumor. Accuracy of around 0.85, an false negatives at 0.18 on a NON-hypertuned model, as my hyptertuner is currently broken.
 - beauty_classification
   - Uses cv2, seaborn, and a convolutional neural network to classify images on a subjective basis of attractiveness as according to a specific dataset. This one should be complete.
 - poetry_sentiment
   - Analyzes the sentiment of poetry using NLP techniques, and compares different methods of approach with multitudes of models. Highest accuracy of .6636, with a dataset standard of .71.
 - wordle_ai
   - At this time, this is a deprecated project. It uses a double-deep Q network to solve wordles based on a custom gym-environment
